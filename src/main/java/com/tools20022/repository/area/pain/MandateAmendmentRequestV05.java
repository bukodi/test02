/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The MandateAmendmentRequest message is sent by the initiator of the request
 * to his agent and/or counterparty. The initiator can both be the debtor or the
 * creditor (or where appropriate the debtor agent).<br>
 * The MandateAmendmentRequest message is forwarded by the agent of the
 * initiator to the agent of the counterparty.<br>
 * A MandateAmendmentRequest message is used to request the amendment of
 * specific information in an existing mandate. The MandateAmendmentRequest
 * message must reflect the new data of the element(s) to be amended and at a
 * minimum a unique reference to the existing mandate. If accepted, this
 * MandateAmendmentRequest message together with the MandateAcceptanceReport
 * message confirming the acceptance will be considered as a valid amendment on
 * an existing mandate, agreed upon by all parties. The amended mandate will
 * from then on be considered the valid mandate.<br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The MandateAmendmentRequest message can contain one or more request(s) to
 * amend a specific mandate.<br>
 * The messages can be exchanged between creditor and creditor agent or debtor
 * and debtor agent and between creditor agent and debtor agent.<br>
 * The message can also be used by an initiating party that has authority to
 * send the message on behalf of the creditor or debtor.<br>
 * The MandateAmendmentRequest message can be used in domestic and cross-border
 * scenarios.<br>
 * If all elements in the existing Mandate need to be amended or the underlying
 * contract is different, then the MandateAmendmentRequest message should not be
 * used. The existing Mandate has to be cancelled and a new Mandate has to be
 * initiated.
